    <h1>Croissants</h1>
    <p>
      A croissant is a French pastry made from puff pastry in a crescent shape.
      <br/><br/>
      It is a buttery, flaky, viennoiserie pastry inspired by the shape of the Austrian kipferl, but using the French yeast-leavened laminated dough. Croissants are named for their historical crescent shape. The dough is layered with butter, rolled and folded several times in succession, then rolled into a thin sheet, in a technique called laminating. The process results in a layered, flaky texture, similar to a puff pastry.
      <br/><br/>
      Crescent-shaped breads have been made since the Renaissance, and crescent-shaped cakes possibly since antiquity. The modern croissant was developed in the early 20th century, when French bakers replaced the brioche dough of the kipferl with a yeast-leavened laminated dough.<br/>
      In the late 1970s, the development of factory-made, frozen, preformed but unbaked dough made them into a fast food that could be freshly baked by unskilled labor. The croissant bakery, notably the La Croissanterie chain, was a French response to American-style fast food, and as of 2008, 30‚Äì40% of the croissants sold in French bakeries and patisseries were baked from frozen dough.
      <br/><br/>
      Croissants are a common part of a continental breakfast in many European countries.
